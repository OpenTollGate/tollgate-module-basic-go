    # The fixture does all the work of finding networks, connecting, and flashing images
    # We just need to verify that the fixture ran and collected results
    # Note: Some flashing operations may fail due to network issues or file conflicts, which is expected

    # We don't assert on the number of successful flashing operations since some failures are expected
